# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains the solutions for 8 case studies listed in **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**.

It showcases my proficiency in SQL querying and thus the ability to problem solve with SQL as a tool.

Special thanks to **[Katie](https://github.com/katiehuangx)** for inspiring me on how to present my very first SQL project!

**Notes:**

```name.py``` is to help me create **Markdown links** easier. It lowercases inputs and replaces spaces with hifen "-". For example, ```Section Name``` will be formatted to ```section-name```. Thus, I can easily do ```[Section Name](section-name)``` for the ```### Section Name``` section.
