# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains the solutions for 8 case studies listed in **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**.

It showcases my proficiency in SQL querying and thus the ability to problem solve with SQL as a tool.

Special thanks to **[Katie](https://github.com/katiehuangx)** for inspiring me on how to present my very first SQL project!
